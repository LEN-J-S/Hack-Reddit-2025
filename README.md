## Inspiration
Fast decision-making and sharp reflexes are essential in many aspects of life, from gaming to real-world problem-solving. We wanted to create a fun yet challenging experience that pushes players to react quickly under pressure while keeping them engaged with dynamic visuals and evolving difficulty levels.

## What it does
My RefleX is a fast-paced reflex-testing game where players must quickly identify and select the correct shape-color combination before time runs out. The game progressively gets harder, introducing shorter reaction times, background color changes, and more deceptive distractors as players advance through rounds.

## How we built it
We developed My RefleX using Devvit, leveraging its UI framework to create a smooth and interactive game experience. The game dynamically generates unique shape-color combinations, randomizes distractors, and adapts difficulty levels based on player performance. Timers and state management ensure a seamless flow between rounds, maintaining the intensity and engagement throughout.

## Challenges we ran into
- Optimizing game balance: Finding the right progression curve for increasing difficulty while keeping the game fun and fair was a challenge.

- Ensuring smooth state transitions: Managing game timers, round resets, and UI updates without causing glitches required careful implementation.

- Dynamic UI adjustments: Adapting the interface for various difficulty levels while maintaining readability and responsiveness.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Creating an engaging reflex-based game with progressive difficulty and dynamic visuals.

- Implementing a seamless game flow with intuitive UI interactions and well-managed timers.

- Designing an adaptive challenge system that keeps players on their toes while ensuring a fair learning curve.

## What we learned
- How to effectively manage real-time state updates for a fast-paced game.
- The importance of progressive difficulty in keeping players engaged with leader board
- How small UI and color changes can significantly impact player perception and reaction times.

## What's next for My RefleX
- More visual effects & animations: Enhance game aesthetics with smooth transitions and effects.
- New game modes: Introduce alternative challenges like memory-based rounds or speed rounds with evolving mechanics.
- Multiplayer mode: Compete against friends or other players in real-time reflex challenges.
